			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>This site plan will have 3 games to virtually play. I will work on the ones that should function, and the plan is to have Uno, Chess, and some sort of a Brain teaser. I will make the last one fully from scratch and have various steps for it.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>This is for people who want to paly games on the internet and to test the games there and to have fun.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I wanted to challenge myself with this task and will try and make the games fully interactive. This site could change drastically depending on the difficulties, but I will try my best to have working AI opponents for the Chess and Uno game with randomized card sets in the Uno game.  </p>
