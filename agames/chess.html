        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>Objective
            The goal of chess is to checkmate your opponent’s king. This happens when the king is in a position to be captured ("in check") and there is no legal move to escape.
            
            Setup
            Chess is played on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares.
            
            Each player starts with 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns.
            
            White moves first, and players alternate turns.
            
            How Each Piece Moves
            King: Moves one square in any direction. Cannot move into check.
            
            Queen: Moves any number of squares in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
            
            Rook: Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
            
            Bishop: Moves any number of squares diagonally.
            
            Knight: Moves in an "L" shape—two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular. Can jump over other pieces.
            
            Pawn: Moves forward one square but captures diagonally. On its first move, a pawn can move two squares forward.
            
            Special Rules
            Castling: A special move that allows the king and a rook to move at the same time to increase safety.
            
            En Passant: A pawn can capture an opponent’s pawn that has moved two squares forward from its starting position.
            
            Pawn Promotion: When a pawn reaches the other side of the board, it can be promoted to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight.
            
            Winning the Game
            Checkmate: If the king is in check and has no legal moves, the game ends.
            
            Stalemate: If a player has no legal moves but is not in check, the game is a draw.
            
            Draw: The game can also end in a draw if neither player has enough material to checkmate, by mutual agreement, or through the 50-move rule (no captures or pawn moves in 50 turns).</p>
